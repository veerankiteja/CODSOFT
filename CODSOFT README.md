# CodSoft Tech Internship Project

Welcome to the CodSoft Tech Internship project repository! As part of my internship, I have worked on various tasks to enhance my skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Below are the tasks:

# Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses

Building a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. The chatbot uses if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provides appropriate responses.

# Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI

Implementing an AI agent capable of playing the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. The AI utilizes algorithms like Minimax, with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning, to ensure an unbeatable gameplay experience.

# Task 3: Image Captioning

Combining computer vision and natural language processing to create an image captioning AI. The solution involves using pre-trained image recognition models such as VGG or ResNet to extract features from images. These features are then fed into a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a transformer-based model to generate descriptive captions for the images.

# Task 4: Recommendation System

Developing a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. The system employs techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend movies, books, or products to users, enhancing their overall experience.

# Task 5: Face Detection and Recognition

Creating an AI application capable of detecting and recognizing faces in images or videos. The application utilizes pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors. Additionally, it may incorporate face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace for advanced identification.
